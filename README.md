I successfully completed a 6-week internship at Marine Electrical and Refrigeration Engineering Work (MEREW), focusing on Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. During this time, I gained hands-on experience in monitoring and controlling industrial processes, enhancing my skills in system integration, troubleshooting, and data analysis within the marine electrical and refrigeration sectors. Additionally, I learned various InTouch SCADA properties, including:

- Animation link
- Visibility
- Alarm handling
- Data logging
- Scripting
- Trending
- Security
- Recipe management
- Real-time data acquisition
- Historical data analysis
- Graphical design
- User interface customization
- Tag management
- Report generation
- User access control
- System backup and recovery
- Custom widgets
- Dynamic Data Exchange

During my internship, I developed a SCADA crane GUI simulator project. This project involved creating a graphical user interface (GUI) that simulated the control and monitoring of crane operations within an industrial setting. The simulator provided a realistic representation of crane movements, load handling, and safety protocols, allowing users to interact with and understand the complexities of crane operations in a controlled environment. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in designing intuitive user interfaces, integrating control systems, and simulating real-world industrial processes using SCADA technology.
